This is the script Kevin was using to try to generate Silo files 
from the restart file provided by Dominic.  

The restart file is available here:

http://www.nic.uoregon.edu/~khuck/octotiger-restart-files

The restart file provided by Dominic that works with the 
"make-silo-viz-paper.sh" script is X.1260.chk.  I usually put that 
file in a different directory, and make a simlink to it with
the name "restart.chk" - otherwise, 
Octotiger will overwrite it as soon as it reads the restart file.

Note: this slurm script is what is required for the Talapas cluster
at UO.  If you want to use it, you will likely have to make modifications.
